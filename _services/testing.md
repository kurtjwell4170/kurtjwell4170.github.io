UnifiedFederal offers comprehensive QA testing solutions â€“ both manual and automated testing, to ensure your new software is running at peak performance. While test automation significantly improves the quality of your software with speed, not all testing can be automated. With UnifiedFederal, we provide the right mix of unit tests, service tests and UI tests for the most holistic solution.

## Support You Can Trust

Remove the burden from overwhelmed teams that need fast results with limited resources. UnifiedFederal ensures all services and dependencies are running smoothly with each change to the software. We provide performance tests to emulate massive numbers of users, smoke tests after deployments and maintenance windows, and automated acceptance tests (AAT) for new feature additions.
