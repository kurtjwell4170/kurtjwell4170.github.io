Adaptive custom software that performs at scale.

# Our Process

An Agile software engineering approach often results in more accountability and less waste for problem analysis, solution design, coding, testing, and product release. The continuous feedback loop fostered with the Agile approach illuminates problems earlier than with other methodologies.

We build cross-functional teams with skillsets that reach across software engineering, architecture, user interface design, cybersecurity, test automation, DevOps and infrastructure to build engaging solutions that perfectly match our client's requirements.

## What is Agile?

Instead of only one long iteration of performing software development life cycle (SDLC) activities sequentially, an Agile team repeatedly conducts these activities in short durations. When you work with Intertech, their team of experienced consultants will help to identify the highest priority business needs and then strive to deliver these needs early in the project cycle, so you achieve your requirements quickly and early in the development process.

## What Are The Project Roles Within The Agile Process?

The Agile process disperses responsibilities among all project team members, increasing accountability with your stakeholders. Besides this, the Agile process has many pragmatic practices. Intertechâ€™s consultants recognize this and focus on the ones best suited for your organization and can customize the approach to work best in your culture to get the most out of the process.

## How Is Progress Measured?

Progress is measured in an Agile project through iterations. Iterations, also known as Sprints in the Scrum methodology, are improvement increments of a product that results in a tangible work product that can be reviewed or demonstrated to the stakeholders. Multiple orchestrated iterations are the foundation of the project. Iterations range from one to four weeks in length. The most common duration of a sprint is two-weeks.
